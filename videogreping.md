We tried looking at the possibilities of generating a video of Obama saying your
speech by taking clips from lots of speeches when he says a certain word. This
is sometimes known as **videogreping**, as in the grep tool for searching for
patterns in text streams. However, it turned out to be too hard to implement in
under a week. It involved installing an incredibly old and badly maintained
collection of software called sphinx and pocketsphinx. It's really old and I've
(Ben) never been able to install it myself before. So we gave up after a couple
of hours of research.
